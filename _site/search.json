Additionally, Bickel (1975) studied these trends in detail. Refer to Kuning (1973) for additional tables and information about the dataset.\nSummary:\nBased on data in the University of California (1973), I was able to compare the number of male and female applicants in each department. Comparing across genders in all 6 departments, Dept A has the highest number of male applicants and Dept C has the highest number of female applicants. The department with the closest/most even dispersion between male and female applicants is Dept D. The department with the largest difference between genders is Department A, with a difference of over 700 applicants. Depts A and C are also the two departments with the highest number of applicants (across all genders). From all 3 graphs that were coded for, the bar graph seems to be the most helpful in terms of truly visualizing and understanding the breakdown/dispersion of ‚Äúmale‚Äù and ‚Äúfemale‚Äù across all 6 departments, visualizing which department had the biggest/smallest gender differences, and quantifying which department had the highest/lowest number of applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes for the TA\n\n\n\n#list out each of the functions you used from each of the packages (dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2)\n\nYour analysis must include some minimal form of data wrangling with you using at least five different functions from dplyr or tidyr.\n\ngroup_by(), mutate(), filter(), select(), arrange(), spread()\n\nYour analysis should include at least three plots with you using at least three different geom_() functions from ggplot2 (or another package with geom_() functions).\n\ngeom_bar, geom_line, geom_boxplot\n\nAt least one plot should using a type of faceting (facet_grid() or facet_wrap()).\n\nfacet_wrap())\n\nYour analysis must include one image or table (not one you created yourself, but one you have saved locally or one from the web).\n\nI put in an image of UC Berkeley‚Äôs Admission‚Äôs logo\n\nYour analysis must include at least two different callout blocks.\n\nCallout box for geom_bar and geom_line and for ‚Äúnote for TA‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBickel, P.
