## [🙋🏻‍♀️ About Me]{.underline}

My name is Amanda Kim, and I'm a second-year doctoral student at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the Department of Mental Health. I am a psychiatric epidemiologist in training under the NIH T32 Psychiatric Epidemiology training grant, studying the co-occurrence of autism spectrum disorder and eating disorders/disordered eating behaviors.

Outside of school, I love to find new hobbies! Some of my new hobbies include 🥁 drums and 🚣🏻‍♂️ rowing with the Baltimore City Row Club. I also have a teaching certificate for Pilates and love to focus on body rehabilitation through breath work on the mat and strength and mobility training on the reformer.
