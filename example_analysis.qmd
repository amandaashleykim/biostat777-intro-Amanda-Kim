[**Example Analysis: Student Admissions at UC Berkeley**]{.underline}

**Question**: Who applied to graduate school at UC Berkeley in 1973? The data is aggregated by the 6 largest departments (in 1973) and classified by admission and sex.

**Intended Audience**: This analysis is intended for the UC Berkeley (office of admissions, etc) to understand the population of applicants

According to @berkeley_dataset, there are notable findings on gender disparity. Additionally, @science_article studied these trends in detail. Refer to @berkeley_admissions for additional tables and information about the dataset.

Summary:

Based on data in the @berkeley_dataset, I was able to compare the number of male and female applicants in each department. Comparing across genders in all 6 departments, Dept A has the highest number of male applicants and Dept C has the highest number of female applicants. The department with the closest/most even dispersion between male and female applicants is Dept D. The department with the largest difference between genders is Department A, with a difference of over 700 applicants. Depts A and C are also the two departments with the highest number of applicants (across all genders). From all 3 graphs that were coded for, the bar graph seems to be the most helpful in terms of truly visualizing and understanding the breakdown/dispersion of "male" and "female" across all 6 departments, visualizing which department had the biggest/smallest gender differences, and quantifying which department had the highest/lowest number of applicants.

Notes for the TA
:::

#list out each of the functions you used from each of the packages (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`)

1.  Your analysis must include some minimal form of data wrangling with you using at least five different functions from `dplyr` or `tidyr`.

group_by(), mutate(), filter(), select(), arrange(), spread()

2.  Your analysis should include at least three plots with you using at least three different geom\_*() functions from ggplot2 (or another package with geom\_*() functions).

geom_bar, geom_line, geom_boxplot

3.  At least one plot should using a type of faceting (facet_grid() or facet_wrap()).

facet_wrap())

4.  Your analysis must include one image or table (not one you created yourself, but one you have saved locally or one from the web).

I put in an image of UC Berkeley's Admission's logo

5.  Your analysis must include at least two different callout blocks.

Callout box for geom_bar and geom_line and for "note for TA"
